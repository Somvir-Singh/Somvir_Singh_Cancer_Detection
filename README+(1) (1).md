# Project Name:Melanoma Detection Assignment
> Brief description of project.
the creation of a CNN-based melanoma detection model. If melanoma is not found in its early stages, it can be fatal. It is responsible for 75% of skin cancer fatalities. A model that can analyse photos and notify doctors of the existence of melanoma might potentially eliminate the need for a lot of manual diagnosis work.


## Table of Contents
* General Info: Training and testing, check for overfitting, visulization, augmentaion, change in overfitting of model, Maximum and minimum distribution of data for different disease class
* [Technologies Used: CNN 
* [Conclusions:Seborrheic keratosis is revealing the minimum distribution
- Pigmented Benign keratosis is revealing the maximum distribution of data
-Melanoma also contributing more as 2nd in distribution compare to others
-Visualize the model results
